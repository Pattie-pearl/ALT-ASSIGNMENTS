   <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p> I'm a passionate and detail-oriented professional with a growing background in Quality Assurance (QA) and a deep interest in software engineering. 
        My journey in tech began through QA, where I developed a keen eye for identifying issues, improving product quality, and ensuring user satisfaction.
        Working closely with development teams sparked my curiosity about how applications are built — 
        not just how to test them — and that is what motivated me to take my learning a step further. 
        Over time, I found myself getting really curious about how the apps I test are actually built — 
        especially the parts users interact with. Through this work, I have gained a solid understanding of the software development lifecycle and the value of clean, 
        efficient code.
        That curiosity led me to start learning frontend engineering!
         I'm currently diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
        and modern frameworks so I can create clean, user-friendly interfaces and also level up my automation game with tools like Cypress and Playwright.
        My big goal? To blend my QA background with frontend skills so I can build beautiful, 
        functional products and test them like a pro. I enjoy exploring how things work behind the scenes — 
        whether it's a mobile app, a website, or a piece of automation. 
        I'm particularly interested in building solutions that are both functional and user-friendly. 
        Outside of coding, I love learning new skills, collaborating on creative ideas, and helping others grow.
        Joining AltSchool is part of my journey to transform my passion into a meaningful career. 
        I am committed to learning, contributing, and growing into a well-rounded engineer who makes a positive impact wherever I go.
        Outside of tech, I enjoy Painting, music, writing, gaming, volunteering and photography. 
        These hobbies not only keep me balanced but also feed my creativity and curiosity — two qualities I believe are essential in engineering.
