    <h1>Meet Patience Okpara: A Student at Alt School Africa</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Patience — a QA Engineer turned Creative Web Enthusiast!
        With 2 years in software testing, I have mastered the art of breaking things (on purpose) to make products better. 
        Now, I am diving into frontend engineering to build beautiful, functional websites and blend creativity with clean code. 
        Whether it is automating tests or crafting user-friendly interfaces, I am all about quality, creativity, and continuous learning.
    </p>

    <h1>A Video that Represents Me</h1>
    <p>I chose a video of a woman reading because it reflects one of my biggest passions—reading. 
        Books fuel my curiosity, inspire my creativity, 
        and constantly push me to grow. 
        Whether it's a novel, a tech blog, or a deep-dive article, reading is where I find both peace and power. 
       This video symbolizes the quiet strength and focus that reading brings into my life.  </p>
